The following is a project completed through the Google Cybersecurity
Professional Program. The repository includes two files. One is risk assessment
report for a ficticious company named "Botium Toys" and the other is a security 
audit that I completed. The goal of this project is to showcase my ability
to assess security concerns and recommend changes for an organization to be 
compliant with NIST benchmarks.
